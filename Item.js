// for each item we maintain a state boolean- true then it is currently borrowed and in this case we have to show returned 
// button instead of delete. Also we dont show these items in search page. Item has a req array
// when a user requests an item, append borrower id to request. and when lender accepts -state change, delete from req . rejects - just delete the request
// for borrower he sees all items that he has requested, for the items with state true we show borrowed with state 0 we show requested
//  suppose two users request for same item, lender accepts one, so we delete all reqs on same item.
